# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** is a data analysis and reporting project that tracks the global trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations. This project uses real-world data to clean, analyze, and visualize the impact of COVID-19 worldwide. It provides a clear view of the pandemic's evolution in different countries, making it easy to compare cases, deaths, and vaccination progress over time.

## Project Objectives

- **Import and Clean COVID-19 Data**: Load the dataset from reliable sources and clean the data for analysis.
- **Analyze Trends Over Time**: Analyze COVID-19 trends such as cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations.
- **Compare Metrics Across Countries**: Compare metrics like new cases, death rates, and vaccination coverage across different countries.
- **Visualize Data**: Create compelling visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and optional choropleth maps to illustrate trends.
- **Report Insights**: Summarize key findings with insights on how the pandemic is evolving in different regions.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language used to build the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations like line charts and bar charts.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical visualizations and graph styling.
- **Plotly** *(optional)*: For building interactive charts (if implemented).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the project, running code, and visualizing results interactively.

## How to Run/View the Project

### Requirements

1. **Python 3.x** - Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. **Required Libraries** - Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```

3. **Dataset** - Download the COVID-19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases). Place the `owid-covid-data.csv` file in your project folder.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the `.ipynb` file and execute the cells to see the data analysis, visualizations, and insights.

### Insights or Reflections

Through this project, I was able to:
- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Analyze and visualize COVID-19 trends across multiple countries over time.
- Create meaningful charts to represent trends in total cases, deaths, new cases, and vaccination progress.
- Summarize the findings in a clear, organized report.

One key insight from this analysis was that different countries have experienced varying rates of vaccine adoption and case fatality rates, which were visible in the visualizations.
